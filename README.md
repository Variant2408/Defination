# Defination
**System Design :** System design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements. It gives developers the tools to manage complexity, make informed trade-offs, and ensure their applications remain fast, reliable, and resilient, even under unpredictable conditions.
